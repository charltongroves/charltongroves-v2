            <h2> march 2017 </h2>
            <h3>What</h3>
            <p> </p>
            <h3>How</h3>
            <p> This website was written from scratch using <span class="text-highlight">HTML5</span>, <span class="text-highlight">CSS</span>,
                and <span class="text-highlight">JS</span>. Everything was written without a framework/template aside from
                the navbar which is from bootstrap</p>
            <h3> Why </h3>
            <p>This website started as a side project around august 2016, I had just finished a web design course and wanted
                to put my skills to the test. <br>It started out not that great. <br>To get an idea of what it looked like
                back then, go to charltongroves.com/crap.html. </p>
            <p>
                This websites primary goal was and still is to be a kind of digital hub of things i've made. It's goal has evolved since
                then to be more of a digital resume. </p>

            <h2> August 2016 - Novembet 2016 </h2>
            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>Duxcom was an open source, isometric, turn based, medieval duck themed video game</p>
            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>The game was made using a plethora of technologies, utilising <span class="text-highlight">test driven development</span>                and <span class="text-highlight">continuous integration</span> . Throghout the project I wrote all my code
                in <span class="text-highlight"> Java</span> (with a bit of <span class="text-highlight">JSON</span>) , and
                used the tools:
                <span class="text-highlight">Git</span> (for version control), <span class="text-highlight">Jenkins</span>                (to assist with continous integration), and
                <span class="text-highlight">SonarQube</span> (for ensuring clean code). I also assisted with some graphic
                design work.
                <h3> Why </h3>
                <p>The project was a part of the course, DECO2800. I chose the subject because I wanted first hand experience
                    in the software development lifecycle, and boy did I get it...</p>

                <h3>What</h3>
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p> richardgrovesarchitects.com was written from scratch using <span class="text-highlight">HTML5</span>,
                    <span class="text-highlight">CSS</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">JS(jquery)</span>. The navbar
                    was from bootstrap. SEO was performed (poorly), and I managed to integrate his business into facebook
                    and google.</p>
                <h3> Why </h3>
                <p>My dad needed a website made for his architecture firm. His old website was extremely outdated and he had
                    absolutely no digital presence.
                    <br> Being the good son I am, I made him one. I worked closely with him throughout the entire design
                    process, adhearing to his every requirment. I drew many, many paper prototypes until a design he liked
                    was found.
                    <br> <br>The website took over 40 hours to make (most of which was redesigning parts he didn't like).
                    I learnt a lot throughout the design process, primarily, how important the requirements/prototyping portion
                    of software development. One miscommunication during that phase can lead to a lot of clean up down the
                    road...
