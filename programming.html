                        <p class="bannerSubtitle">mobile UI concept - charlton groves</p>
            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>SyncUQ is the first UQ exclusive schedule sharing social media platform. It lets users find 
                when their friends are on a break between uni classes, allowing them to quickly find friends who are free to hangout with. <br><br>NOTE: as of 19/03/2017, SyncUQ is still under construction. A full release will be avaliable in late May 2017.
            </p>
            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>SyncUQ runs on the heroku platform, 
                it uses a <span class="text-highlight">Python</span> backend (using the flask framework) and utilises SQLAlchemy as an ORM to a postgres database. 
                The front end is written in <span class="text-highlight">PureScript</span>, a strongly typed lang which compiles to html/css/js.</p>
            <h3> Why </h3>
            <p>SyncUQ was made by myself, Max Bo, and Hugo Kawamata. It was conceived after we all realised how often we ask each other "are you free?" or "you at uni?". 
                We pitched it to a few classmates who all agreed that it would be an awesome app, after this we got to work.

            <p class="bannerSubtitle"></p>
            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>Duxcom is an open source, isometric, turn based, medieval duck themed video game</p>
            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>The game was made using a plethora of technologies, utilising <span class="text-highlight">test driven development</span>                and <span class="text-highlight">continuous integration</span> . Throghout the project I wrote all my code
                in <span class="text-highlight"> Java</span> (with a bit of <span class="text-highlight">JSON</span>) , and
                used the tools:
                <span class="text-highlight">Git</span> (for version control), <span class="text-highlight">Jenkins</span>                (to assist with continous integration), and
                <span class="text-highlight">SonarQube</span> (for ensuring clean code). I also assisted with some graphic
                design work.
                <h3> Why </h3>
                <p>The project was a part of the course, DECO2800. I chose the subject because I wanted first hand experience
                    in the software development lifecycle, and boy did I get it...</p>

            <p class="bannerSubtitle"></p>
                <h3>What</h3>
                <p><a href="http://www.richardgrovesarchitects.com">www.richardgrovesarchitects.com</a>
                    <br>
                    A website designed to showcase the skills and work of the company.
                </p>
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p> richardgrovesarchitects.com was written from scratch using <span class="text-highlight">HTML5</span>,
                    <span class="text-highlight">CSS</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">JS(jquery)</span>. The navbar
                    was from bootstrap. SEO was performed (poorly), and I managed to integrate his business into facebook
                    and google.</p>
                <h3> Why </h3>
                <p>My dad needed a website made for his architecture firm. His old website was extremely outdated and he had
                    absolutely no digital presence.
                    <br> Being the good son I am, I made him one. I worked closely with him throughout the entire design
                    process, adhearing to his every requirment. I drew many, many paper prototypes until a design he liked
                    was found.
                    <br> <br>The website took over 40 hours to make (most of which was redesigning parts he didn't like).
                    I learnt a lot throughout the design process, primarily, how important the requirements/prototyping portion
                    of software development. One miscommunication during that phase can lead to a lot of clean up down the
                    road...

                <h3>What</h3>
                <p> A remake of the classic game tetris on an atmel 74HC chipset. The game contained features such as high score tracking, 8 bit sound, and
                    joystick support </p>
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>The game was written in C using the atmel studio IDE.</p>
                <h3> Why </h3>
                <p>The game was made as part of the assement for an embedded systems programming course. A breadboard and chipset were given to us along with some basic boilerplate code. From this we had a few weeks to implement as many features as we could. </p>

            <h2> June 2017 - Present </h2>
            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>You're looking at it :)</p>
            <h3>How</h3>
            <p> This website was written from scratch using <span class="text-highlight">HTML5</span>, <span class="text-highlight">CSS</span>,
                and <span class="text-highlight">JS</span>. Everything was written without a framework/template aside from
                the navbar which is from bootstrap</p>
            <h3> Why </h3>
            <p>This website started as a side project around august 2016, I had just finished a web design course and wanted
                to put my skills to the test. <br>It started out not that great. But as my skills got better I redesigned it over and over again until I was satisfied. This website will continue to evolve with my skills so checkback in a year or two to see something hopefully pretty amazing.</p>
            <p>
                This websites primary goal was and still is to be a kind of digital hub of things i've made. It's goal has evolved since
                then to be more of a digital resume. </p>
