    <h1> This Website</h1>
    <h2> march 2017 </h2>
    <h3>How</h3>
    <p> This website was written from scratch using <span class="text-highlight">HTML5</span>, <span class="text-highlight">CSS</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">JS</span>. Everything was written without a framework/template aside from the navbar which is from bootstrap</p>
    <h3> Why </h3>
    <p>This website started as a side project around august 2016, I had just finished a
        web design course and wanted to put my skills to the test. <br>It started out not that 
        great. <br>To get an idea of what it looked like back then, go to charltongroves.com/crap.html. </p>
        <p>
        This websites primary goal was and still is to be a kind of digital hub of things i've made. It's goal 
        has evolved since then to be more of a digital resume. </p>

    <h1>Richard Groves Architects</h1>
    <h2> november 2016 - present </h2>
    <h3>How</h3>
    <p> richardgrovesarchitects.com was written from scratch using <span class="text-highlight">HTML5</span>, <span class="text-highlight">CSS</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">JS(jquery)</span>. The navbar was from bootstrap</p>
    <h3> Why </h3>
    <p>My dad needed a website made for his architecture firm. His old website was extremely outdated and he has absolutely no digital presence
        <br> being the good son that I am, I made him one. I worked closely with him throughout the entire design process, adhearing to his every requirment. And drew many many paper prototypes until a design he liked was found.
        <br> <br>The website took over 40 hours to make (most of which was redesigning parts he didn't like). I learnt a lot throughout the design process, primarily, how important the requirements/prototyping portion of software development. One miscommunication during that phase can lead to a lot of clean up down the road...
